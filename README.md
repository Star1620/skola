Simple pure HTML pages with modified CSS, used HTML5, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap without added JavaScript or use PHP or Python. Build for first school Project.
Made from scratch, used NetBeans IDE (8.2), SASS converter (Dart Sass 1.22.10), Google Chrome (76.0.3809.100), notepad and installed GIT (2.22.0 for Windows).
Site consist of four pages with the same layout: version for devices with resolution more than 990px background orange/brick ; for devices with screen smaller than 989px in blue colors.
There are responsive elements, some paragraphs, headings and/or table columns are visible only on bigger screens. 
I build SCSS file with variables, nesting or inheritance and compiled it by Dart Sass into standard css, which is used by pages.
I tested links and responsive elements also in Opera (62.0.3331.116), Firefox (68.0.2) and it works fine.
